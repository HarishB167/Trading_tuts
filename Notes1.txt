Section 1 : Step 1 - Path to Profitability

- 90% traders are not successful,
only 5% makes money.

- First don't try to earn profit or to have monthly earning,
but focus on preventing giving (losing) money to market.

- Then after some time try to goto (jump) profitability side.
* Not easy
* Discipline is needed
* Hardwork and everyday research

- Answer questions as a trader
* What are you expecting from market?
Big mistake : expect too much from market.
Market is get rich slowly scheme.

- Trading system
* Should be designed and followed.
* Trading setup is small part of this system.
* Risk management (most important)
Max loss, Position sizing
* Trade management (very important)
Entry and SL level, Profit booking & trailing
* Technical analysis (important)
Patterns and trade setup
* Tuning psychology with setup is required
Unable to follow setup if not tuned.
You will understand that after lots of hits and misses.

- Price Action (PA) - why?
* It is the purest form of charts.
* No analysis paralysis
* Once you master PA reading, you can trade 
any assets class eg: stocks/indices/currency etc.

- DP trading for intraday
* Decision point trade
* There are few levels that are important for gauging the
market sentiment and are likely to provide us the first
clue to a continuation/reversal in the short term trend.
> PDH: Previous day high
> PDL: Previous day low
> PDC: Previous day close
> DO: Day open
* Levels having - suspected breakout, high volume etc.
* All 4 DPs are considered important in TA.
* In range trading - PDH, PDL are used, which are range extremes for previous day.
Continuation or reversal of trend happens
* Make a system where only you get minimum to minimum no of trades.
Take trade only these 2 levels, based on trade setup.
* Minumum no of trades.
> Either take fewer trades
> Or take trades with small stoplos (not possible for newcomer)

- Price Action trade setup
* Figure out the larger trend
* Mark DP levels where there can be increased volumes.
* Observe PA at these DPs for any indication of trapped traders (buyer or seller).
* Trade on the side of the side of stronger player(larger trend)
* Take your profits and minimize risk at the first instance.
* Additional points
> As a beginner - book profit partially (75%) at 1:1 stoploss and
remaining (25%) at target price. And let the market go in possible profit direction.

- Trend following rules
* In a down trend the down move is intact unless the closing of the day 
is above the PDH.
* In an uptrend the trend is considered intact unless the price 
closes below the PDL.
* Closing is actual closing and not the exchange calculated
average. Trade happened at 03:30 PM

- 3 Tradeable setups
* PDH/PDL trades: Trades only at these DP levels.
Easy to Trade. Non profitable traders should only
trade this setup.
* TCC Trades: Trend-consolidation continuation trades.
Moderately easy to trade.
* VWAP Trades: Trade only after observing PA at vwap.
Not easy to trade.

- Trade Dairy
* Date, SL, 1RR, SL, 2RR, Remarks,
Trend remarks, emptyCol, Winners, Losers, Scratch
* 18 out of 40 days traded.
* Scratch - trade doesn't hit anyone, target or stoploss.
* 3 minutes candle

- Daily Charts
* Close of 17th is below low of 16th
* 17th is trend change day
* Find short trade in 18th, at previous day(17th) high or low.
* Don't take trade till 09:30

- 3 min candle
* On 18th day, let price go below previous day(17th) low.
* Wait till it moves direction to up, then after again downwards continuation.
* When it reaches current day's low, then take trade.
* Stop loss at price where direction changed from up to down, near previous day low.
* If price goes to 1RR, then close 50% position and move SL to entry price.
* Then if price goes to 2RR the close remaining position.
* Now, do nothing, wait till it comes to previous day(17th) high or low.

- Trend change day
